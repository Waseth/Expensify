# Expensify

### A personal money system born from real student life.

When I joined university, my mum sent me a monthly allowance to cover my daily life — food, transport, groceries, and basic needs.  
At first, I thought budgeting was simple: "Just track what you spend".

But real life wasn’t simple.

Some months, I would carefully calculate a shopping list, yet still end up with money left.  
Other times, I would overspend on groceries or transport without realizing how much it would affect the rest of my month.  
And even when I tried to spend “exactly” the budget, I somehow found myself buying clothes, going out with friends, or treating myself — and the money still didn’t finish.

I realized something important:

> **The problem wasn’t tracking expenses.  
> The problem was not understanding how my money was flowing.**

So I built **Expensify**.

## 💡 What This App Does Differently

Instead of just logging expenses, this app models **how money moves**:

```

Monthly allowance(Allocated total from monthly budget calculations)
↓
Needs Budget (fixed + weekly)
↓ (underspend or overspend)
My Income (surplus)
↓
Savings (50%) + Personal (50%)

```

Every shilling is accounted for.  
Every good decision becomes visible.  
Every mistake becomes a lesson.

## 🎯 Why I Built This

I wanted a system that:
- Shows where leftover money comes from  
- Rewards discipline  
- Teaches me how today’s choices affect tomorrow  

This app turned confusion into clarity — and leftover money into intentional money.
